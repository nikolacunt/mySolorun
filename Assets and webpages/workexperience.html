    <h1>My work experience.</h1>
    <hr/>
    <p>Working as a graphic designer for prominent pages like 28. Jun and LeagueAlerts on Instagram has been a transformative experience in my professional journey. These roles have allowed me to hone my creative skills while contributing to brands with significant online presence.

        At 28. Jun, I focused on creating visually engaging content that resonated with a diverse audience. This role taught me the importance of understanding target demographics and crafting designs that not only capture attention but also convey the brand's message effectively.
        <br>
        
        Similarly, my work with LeagueAlerts involved designing graphics that appealed to a passionate gaming community. Here, I learned to balance aesthetic appeal with functionality, ensuring that information was easily digestible while still maintaining a vibrant visual style.
        
        Both experiences have deepened my appreciation for the power of visual communication and strengthened my ability to work collaboratively in fast-paced environments. As I continue to grow in this field, I am excited about the opportunities that lie ahead and the potential to create impactful designs that resonate with audiences.</p>
